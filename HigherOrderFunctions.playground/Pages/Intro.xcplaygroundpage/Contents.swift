 ==== Higher Order Functions ====
 
 Using map, filter or reduce to operate on Swift collection types such as Array or Dictionary is something that can take getting used to. Unless you have experience with functional languages your instinct may be to reach for the more familiar for-in loop. With that in mind here is my guide to using map, filter, reduce (and flatMap and compactMap).
 
 - map returns an Array containing results of applying a transform to each item.
 - filter returns an Array containing only those items that match an include condition.
 - reduce returns a single value calculated by calling a combine closure for each item with an initial value.
