 Use filter to loop over a collection and return an Array containing only those elements that match an include condition.
 
 Filter on array:
 
 The swift autocomplete shows the following if we try to use filter method for an Int array.
 
 As you can see, the filter function calls a closure called isIncluded which takes one int as argument and returns a Bool . So, the isIncluded closure will return a bool value for each collection item and based on this result a new filtered array will be generated.
